# Bittrex-API-Bash-Scripts

My bash adapation of some of the PHP examples for interacting with the bittrex API, demonstrating how to use authenticated calls.

I've tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and MacOS 10.11-10.13

Note that jq is required to run these scripts:  https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/

Bittrex's API Documentation is here:  https://support.bittrex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003723911-Developer-s-Guide-API

Let me know if this helped you out!

Donations always welcome!!

P.S - These are just basic scripts to show basic concepts.  There are no built in checks and balances to make sure that you aren't sending your money somewhere daft.  Store and use your API keys wisely and use these scripts at your own risk.  If buying, selling, or withdrawing using the Bittrex API, check your work before you press enter!

Cheers,

Neil
